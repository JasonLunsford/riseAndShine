# Rise and Shine!

Rise and Shine is a happy little application designed to give you a quick, at a glance reference for the day's sunrise / sunset times, the current time, the position of the sun relative to the time, and the current weather. It will calculate these values based on zipcode (requested on startup).

This application is designed for mobile, tablet, and desktop resolutions.

Privacy will be respected at all times. My goal here is to learn some cool new techniques while providing a useful app at the end of it.

Thank you!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
